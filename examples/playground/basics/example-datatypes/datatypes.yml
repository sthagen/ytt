#! by using '#@' comment at the end of the line,
#! you can specify value for the node on that line.

nullz: #@ None

true_bool: #@ True
false_bool: #@ False

integer: #@ 123
float: #@ 123.123

#! note how string got serialized, without quotes
string: #@ "value"

#! but string that contains '#' (one of special YAML characters)
#! was correctly written by YAML library with quotes
string_quoted: #@ "#value"

nested_map: #@ {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}

list: #@ ["item1", "item2"]
list_with_a_map: #@ [{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}, "item2"]

#! setting value of YAML document node works as well

--- #@ "document-value"
--- #@ [1, "item1", {"key1": "value1"}]
