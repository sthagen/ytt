#! it would be pretty hard to do most templating
#! tasks without supporting some conditional logic

#@ if True:
key1a: inside-if1
#@ end

#! alternatively if conditional applies to one YAML
#! node, you can use 'if/end' to avoid an extra line

#@ if/end True:
key1b: inside-if1

#! if/end would not work for the following example
#! that needs to span several YAML nodes

#@ if True:
key2a: keya
key2b: keyb
key2c: keyc
#@ end

#! of course we can nest ifs any way we want
#! as long as 'end's are properly closed

#@ if True:
key3a:
  #@ something = 123
  #@ if/end something > 10:
  nested_key:
    another_key: inside-if-nif
#@ else:
key3a: inside-else1
key3b: inside-else2
#@ end
