`ytt` (pronounced spelled out) is a templating tool that understands YAML structure allowing you to focus on your data instead of how to properly escape it.

[![](docs/ytt-playground-screenshot.png)](https://get-ytt.io/#example:example-demo)

Features:

- templating works on YAML structure (instead of text)
  - which eliminates variety of problems such as invalid YAML formatting, escaping, etc.
- syntactic sugar for single YAML node conditionals and for loops
  - makes it easier to read densely conditioned templates
- templates are themselves valid YAML files
  - makes them friendly to existing editors and YAML tools
- includes *sandboxed* "fully featured" Python-like programming language
- allows configuration modularization via functions and libraries
